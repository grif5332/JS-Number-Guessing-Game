# JS-Number-Guessing-Game
Basic Rules:
1) When you make a guess, the disply will tell you whether you are too high or too low.
2) If you quess the right number, a point is added to your score, you get 5 guesses added to your guess pool, and 20 is added to the range.
3) If you use all your guesses the game is over.
